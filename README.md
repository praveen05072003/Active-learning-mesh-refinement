This project implements an AI/ML-driven active learning system for dynamic mesh refinement during CAE simulations.
The system uses real-time feedback from simulation results (such as error estimates or residuals) to refine the mesh adaptively in regions where accuracy improvement is required â€” ensuring optimal mesh density while minimizing computational cost.
